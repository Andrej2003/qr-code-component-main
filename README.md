## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that using the rem unit really eases the process of making responsive pages and unwise use of percentages when specifying the width can mess up the page. In such a case we should use fixed measurements.

### Continued development

I would like get more comfortable with using position.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3250790/making-a-div-that-covers-the-entire-page) - I got the idea to use ```position: absolute;``` from here.
